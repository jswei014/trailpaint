## What it is

TrailPaint works in three beats: **collect, edit, share**.

1. **Collect** — import photos straight from your phone (EXIF GPS auto-creates spots), or have ChatGPT / Claude generate an itinerary JSON and paste it back
2. **Edit** — reorder, write captions, draw routes, and overlay historical maps on desktop
3. **Share** — export an IG-ready illustration, a short link, or an embeddable auto-touring player

| Feature | Details |
|------|------|
| 📷 **Photo import** | EXIF GPS auto-creates spots sorted by capture time; multi-day trips get one route per day via "connect spots" |
| 🤖 **AI workflow** | Built-in prompt template — LLM-generated itinerary JSON imports in one paste, with auto photo-fetch from Wikimedia Commons |
| ⏱ **Time-travel storytelling** | Era slider + Academia Sinica historical map overlays + auto-touring stories |
| 🖼️ **Many outputs** | PNG (IG / blog) / short links / iframe embeds / GPX·KML·GeoJSON interchange |
| 🔐 **Privacy first** | No backend, all data stays in your browser, works offline |

## Quick start

Open [trailpaint.org/app/](https://trailpaint.org/app/) and pick one of the three cards on the start screen:

<img src="./examples/mobile-start.jpg" width="320" alt="Mobile start screen — three action cards">

- **📷 Import Photos** — pick 20 trip photos; GPS pins them, capture time orders them, done in a minute
- **🤖 Paste AI JSON** — copy the prompt template to ChatGPT / Claude, paste the generated JSON back
- **🗺️ Start on the Map** — on phones just tap the map to add a spot (no mode switching); desktop has a full tool dock; sample trails are one tap away

Then hit **Export**, choose a ratio and style, and download a PNG or create a share link.

---

## Three ways to build

### 📷 From photos

Shoot with GPS on → drop the photos in → coordinates, chronological order, and reverse-geocoded names come for free. iPhone HEIC and Android JPEG both work; photos without GPS are placed by time-neighbor interpolation and can be dragged into place. **Multi-day trips: "connect spots" draws one route per day.**

### 🤖 With AI

The import dialog ships a prompt template: describe your trip to ChatGPT / Claude → paste the generated JSON back. Optionally auto-fetch CC-licensed photos from Wikimedia Commons (attribution included). Great for trip planning, history, or fiction.

### 🗺️ By hand

Search places, add spots, draw hand-drawn-style routes. Tap-to-add on phones, full tool dock and properties panel on desktop.

**Import formats:** photos (EXIF), GPX (hiking apps), KML (Google My Maps), GeoJSON, .trailpaint backups, screenshots as basemaps

---

## Output & sharing

| Format | Use |
|------|------|
| **PNG** | 1:1 (IG feed) / 9:16 (Story) / 4:3 / original; 3 frames × 2 filters |
| **Short link** | photos travel with it, OG preview uses the cover (Cloudflare Workers, 90-day TTL) |
| **iframe embed** | drop an interactive player into WordPress, Notion, Substack |
| **.trailpaint backup** | full project file — restore after switching devices |
| **GeoJSON / KML** | for geojson.io, Google My Maps, Google Earth (geometry only) |

![Export — image tab](./examples/export-wizard-image.jpg)

There's also an **AI stylization prompt** (Japanese sketch / treasure map / cozy cartoon / minimal line) — feed your exported PNG to ChatGPT / Gemini for a truly hand-painted look:

## Story Player: maps that tell stories

**[Story Player](https://trailpaint.org/app/player/)** turns a static map into a guided tour: fly-to animations, photo cards, background music, and fullscreen mode — built for exhibitions, classrooms, and web embeds.

- **⏱ Era slider** — drag to cross-fade historical basemaps (Academia Sinica Han/Tang/Song/Yuan/Ming China + Taiwan 1897/1921/1966 + Roman Empire AD 200) while spots fade by era
- **📚 Compilations** — bundle story chapters into one player, ordered by narrative or by global chronology
- **📮 Postcards** — one-tap 1080×1080 square per spot (map + spot card + era stamp)

Featured story maps ([all →](https://trailpaint.org/stories/)):

- **Taiwan Missionaries** — Mackay, Barclay and others, overlaid on the 1897 Japanese-era map
- **Passion Week** — 12+ biblical sites with classical paintings and YouVersion links
- **Paul's Three Journeys** — 34 spots across the AD 46-62 Mediterranean
- **Silk Road 2000 Years** — Zhang Qian → Xuanzang → Marco Polo on the same corridor
- **Yu Yonghe's 1697 Journey** — a sulfur expedition across Qing-era Taiwan

For churches there's a dedicated [`/church/`](https://trailpaint.org/church/) landing page (Sunday school, bulletin, devotional embeds).
